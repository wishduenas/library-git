# library-git
Library is meant to serve as an interface to browse your collection of pdfs.

It works with the use of Branches and Topics in order to organise the files into "physical" shelves, each with its corresponding tag
for identification.

When you want to add a new pdf to your collection, you must save the file in the same folder where library.html is and rename it
according to the following format:

"Book title ([Edition number]) - Lastname.pdf"

Then, open the register option at the bottom of the Library and fill in the info required. Consider that Branches will be represented
as cabinets, while Topics will be the shelves. Push the Finish button and copy the text which appears in the white box. Finally, paste
that code into the books.js file found in the assets folder within the Library folder.
